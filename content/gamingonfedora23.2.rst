:summary: Gaming on Fedora 23

Ultimately if you're going to be doing any serious gaming on Fedora there are two major things I can't imagine not having. A dedicated Nvidia graphics card (I'm using an EVGA GTX 970 FTW+) and the Negativo17 repos available from Negativo17.org and https://github.com/negativo17. The Steam, Handbrake, Spotify and Nvidia plugins are all outstanding and very easy to use.
