Summary: About me

My name is Max Whittingham, I work at Red Hat on the OpenShift Online PaaS but this blog is entirely a personal one. Thoughts and feelings expressed are mine and mine alone. I drink lots of espresso, love gadgets, Free and Open Source software and the sweet clickity-clack of mechanical keyboards.
