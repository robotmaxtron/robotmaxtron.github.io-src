:summary: Getting started with Pelican

After wanting to get started with Pelican for a while, I finally found some time to get it up and running on a Github page thanks to a guide up on Fedora Magazine (http://fedoramagazine.org/make-github-pages-blog-with-pelican/)

Though I have to admit that the idea of using git submodules doesn't feel like the best approach, unless I'm missing something. I ended up simply cloning the robotmaxtron.github.io repo in the 'output' directory which seems to be a more straight forward way to use Pelican.
