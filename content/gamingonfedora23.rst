:summary: Gaming on Fedora 23

After underwhelming results with the Intel Iris 6100 graphics on an i7 Intel NUC (which I had two die within a month on me) I decided to scrap that plan and build out a modern Mini ITX gaming/workstation rig.

Intel i5 6500
Gigabyte GAH170N-WIFI
Samsung SM951 512GB ACHI m.2 SSD
16GB of Corsair Vengeance LPX (2 x 8GB) DDR4 2133
EVGA 650w Gold Rated Power Supply
EVGA Nvidia GTX 970 4GB FTW+

Fedora installation went really smoothly, pretty quickly was able to get everything updated to Fedora 23 (once Nvidia pushed the update for xorg 1.18 support). Special thanks to Negativo17 for his outstanding Steam,Nvidia,Handbrake and several other repos that I am using.

There's more games than ever with native Linux support, I'm hearing news almost every day about future games supporting Linux.
